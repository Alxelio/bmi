# bmi
bmi - body mass index from terminal

# Number 1
I created the Class Person in a new file just to make this code clean and better for refactoring.

# Number 2
I received someone's name, weight and height from terminal, handling some exceptions as null value for String and placed zero in double variables when it is necessary.

# Number 3
I made a new file called reading.dart just to componentize the code. I launched some new exceptions as well.

# Number 4
I placed a new file called exceptions for handling some exceptions in this code, just to avoid some errors.
