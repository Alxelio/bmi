# bmi
bmi - body mass index from terminal

# Number 1
I created the Class Person in a new file just to make this code clean and better for refactoring.

# Number 2
I received someone's name, weight and height from terminal, handling some exceptions as null value for String and placed zero in double variables when it is necessary.

# Number 3
I made a new file called reading.dart just to componentize the code. I launched some new exceptions as well.

# Number 4
I placed a new file called exceptions for handling some exceptions in this code, just to avoid some errors.

# Number 5
I've finished making changes at exceptions file at the moment.

# Number 6
I added a simple calculus just to check it.

# Number 7
I placed a function calculus(bmi) in a new file called cauculus.dart for calculating the someone's body mass index. 

# Number 8
I made a file for testing the exceptions.dart file and its content, like convert comma to point and the other one, making some checks about negative values or zero ones for weight and height.
